### Color Scheme

![Color scheme](Read.me/palette.png)
### Thoughts behind choosing this color scheme:
This palette draws from the rich, comforting hues of spices and baked goods themselves—colors that evoke warmth and a sense of welcoming. Each color was carefully selected to represent the authenticity and heartfelt warmth that baking brings into homes.
These colors not only create a visually appealing website but also resonate deeply with the sensory experiences of baking. They reflect a return to tradition and authenticity, much like the timeless art of baking itself. This palette promises a genuine, down-to-earth experience—what you see is what you get.

### Fonts
Arial, Sans-Serif
